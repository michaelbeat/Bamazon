# Bamazon

### Project - Bamazon

This application is modeled after Amazon and is set up to allow a customer to choose from a list of items that they would like to purchase. The customer will first choose what kind of snack they would like: salty or sweet. Then they will be presented with a list of either sweet or salty snacks. Customers can then decide what kind of snack they would like. 

### Resources and Setup

I utilized mySQL via the mySQL Workbench to create my table of snacks. I only used one table right now as I only have just sweet and salty snacks to choose from. I would like to set it up to have multiple tables to help make the application more of a general store with other options besides just food.
